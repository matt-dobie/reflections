When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using a remote repo is a good way to backup your work. It also allows you
    to work collaboratively with others, allowing multiple people to work on
    the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It gives you more control. If something is accidentally deleted from the
    remote, then you don't want to lose something locally! And vice versa.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    A branch is used in a single repo when trying to develop a new feature or
    version of your project, without affecting the main 'master' version. A 
    clone creates an exact copy of a repo, either locally or from GitHub to
    a local repo. A fork is an exact copy from one user on GitHub to another,
    that allows you to add your own changes, while still giving credit to the
    original creator.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
